# Membership Management System

## Description
This is a Membership Management System designed to help organizations manage their membership, quotas, payments, and other related activities. This system is built to provide an easy-to-use interface for administrators to manage their members information and activities.

## Features
* **Member Management:** Add, update, and delete member information including name, contact details, and membership status.
Membership Quota Management: Define membership quotas for different types of memberships, such as monthly, annual, or lifetime. Set prices and expiration dates for each quota.

* **Payment Management:** Record and track member payments for their respective quotas. Provide various payment options, such as online payment, bank transfer, or cash.

* **Renewal Management:** Automatically generate renewal reminders for expiring memberships and provide options for renewing membership.
Reporting: Generate reports on member activities, payment status, and membership trends. Export reports in various formats such as CSV or PDF.

## Purpose
This project is a personal initiative for the Coding Dojo Bootcamp. It aims to provide a practical application of the skills learned during the bootcamp, particularly in the areas of web development, databases, and project management. By building this membership management system, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the technologies involved, as well as to develop a portfolio piece that can showcase our skills to potential employers.
